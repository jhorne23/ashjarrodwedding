## Why Jenolan Caves?
We went here on our first ever road trip, and were taken aback by how beautiful it was. Our first cave tour was into the Lucas Cave, and we immediately knew this is where we wanted to be married. We've been here regularly since, and we love that it's so secluded and awe-inspiring. 

## What should I wear? 
Dress style is semi-formal. It is consistently 15-17 degrees in the cave, and you’ll emerge into cool, Spring air. 
Comfortable footwear is also strongly recommended as there are 300 stairs to climb to get inside the cave. We promise it’s worth it!

## Why is your ceremony ‘Unplugged’? What does that mean?
We’d love for you to be present in the moment with us, so we are asking that there be no cameras or phones on during the ceremony. The lighting is not the best, and we’d love for our photographer to be able to take his best photographs without flash interruption and changing light.
However, the reception will be a photographic free-for-all! Please use the hashtag #PBandJenolan on social media so we can track all the photos down later! 

## Which Cave tours should we go on while you’re busy getting ready and freaking out?
We will recommend the River Cave if you want the most extensive view of the caves, but sometimes this one isn’t open. The Pool of Cerberus tour follows parts of the underground river, and is also gorgeous. The Temple of Baal is also a favourite of ours which we would we would highly recommend. The free Nettle Cave tour is gorgeous, and the trip to the Devil's Coach House is not to be missed.
We’re getting married in the Lucas Cave, so avoid this cave tour unless you want a preview of the big event!

## I would love to give you both a gift! What would you like? 

At the time of getting married, we will have lived together for 5 years. We have a toaster, a slow cooker, and everything we could possibly need. Your presence with us, and your enjoyment of Jenolan caves is all that we we really want. 
If you do feel so compelled, we would be forever grateful for a contribution to our honeymoon in Bali and a card with all of your well wishes.
