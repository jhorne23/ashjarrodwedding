Ceremony begins at 4pm in the Lucas Cave. You will be escorted there by a Jenolan Caves guide. Please meet the 
guide at the reception desk of Caves House at 3.30pm.

Following the ceremony, walking around the Blue Lake is a lovely option if you would like to see more of Jenolan.
The resident platypus likes to come out at dawn and dusk, so keep an eye out around this time! There is also Jeremiah's Bar in Caves House, if you'd
like to have a drink.

The Reception will begin at 6.30pm in the Chisolms Grand Dining Room of Caves House in Jenolan Caves. 
We will serve entree, main, and wedding cake for dessert, and a bar tab for the bar in the room. There will be 
lots of dancing, tear-jerking speeches about how dorky we were when we were 13, and a photobooth. The reception will finish at 11pm.
